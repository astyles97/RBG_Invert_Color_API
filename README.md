# RBG_Invert_Color_API
An API written in Python using the Flask framework to return the inverted color value of an RGB color value.

The Flask module is imported and only two routes are created. A "home" route instructs the user to enter the nine-digit RGB color code, with no separation of the digits. The second route returns the calculation to give the inverted color value through URL parsing. Casting is utilized to allow the user-entered data to be iterated, joined, and then subtracted.
